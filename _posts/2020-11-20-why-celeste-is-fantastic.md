> Note the following write-up contains spoilers from the video game: Celeste all the way until the epilogue. 



Celeste left me in awe. 

There are so many aspects to this that I wanna talk about! -
- Plot and characters
- Game design
- Art/graphics
- Music



#### Context (skip if you know the plot of the game)


A young woman named Madeline begins climbing Celeste Mountain, ignoring a warning from an old woman who lives at the base. Madeline makes her way through a deserted city, where she meets a traveler named Theo. Madeline camps out for the night and has a dream in which a dark reflection of herself, named Badeline, breaks out of a mirror, and attempts to stop Madeline's climb, but Madeline escapes from her and wakes up from her nightmare.

Madeline continues into an old hotel on the mountain, where the hotel's ghostly concierge, Mr. Oshiro, tries to persuade Madeline to stay despite the dingy condition of the hotel. She reluctantly entertains him by cleaning part of the resort, but he is keen on having her stay for a night. This leads to Badeline reappearing and creating an escape for Madeline, but insulting Oshiro in the process, enraging him. He chases Madeline out, and Madeline continues the climb.

After traveling past the hotel, Madeline meets up with Theo at a cable cart. Mid-ride, the cart stalls, giving Madeline a panic attack. Theo calms her down, and the cart moves again, arriving at an ancient temple. Theo ends up separated and encased in a crystal and monsters given form from Madeline and Theo's insecurities attack them. She finds Theo and frees him from the crystal. Madeline then carries Theo out of the temple.

After breaking Theo's crystal and escaping from the temple, Madeline and Theo set up a campfire. Madeline tells Theo about the reflection and confides in him about her mental health issues before resting. During the night, she seeks out Badeline and expresses her wishes to leave Badeline behind. This angers Badeline, and forces Madeline to plummet down to the base of the mountain. Stuck in a cave at the bottom of the mountain, Madeline meets the old woman again, who suggests that Badeline might be scared and says that Madeline should try talking instead of abandoning her. 

Madeline searches for Badeline again, apologizes for pushing her away and vows to climb the mountain together. Badeline initially lashes out at Madeline, but relents and forgives her. Badeline and Madeline merge, and they work their way back up the mountain, before finally reaching the summit.


The story is given closure with Theo and Madeline, meeting at the base of the mountain along with the old lady and Mr. Oshiro, and unwinding.

#### The experience

![img](http://www.celestegame.com/images/completes/complete-7.png)

One might say the game is about a girl who wants to climb a mountain. 

Another might say that the game is about a girl confronting her unresolved and repressed issues and learning to accept them, in order to grow and rise to a challenge. 

And that's something I loved about Celeste - it's open to interpretation. 

It's so easy to imagine the mountain as a metaphor for a difficult or personal obstacle. 

It's so easy to empathize with Madeline. 

It's so easy to personify the part of you that you hate and feel exactly what Madeline did - the frustration, the confusion, the helplessness. 

It all felt so relatable that I was emotionally invested in Madeline and at one point I was projecting my own emotions onto her and Badeline. 

When I started playing Celeste, I didn't expect to play a game that would shed light on mental health, depression and anxiety - but it doing so only made me appreciate it more. 

As the story proceeds, there were times when the game broke the rules of reality, but it was so easy to accept and go along with, since I was interpreting the storyline at a metaphorical level. 

Parts where Madeline soared through the sky, or talked to the physical manifestation of her reflection, or dealt with monsters out to kill her - it was so easy to observe them as metaphors for her own inner demons, voices and psyche. 

Never was my immersion broken, and my interpretation of it was consistent throughout the plot which makes me wonder whether it was the intended interpretation for it as well. 

Then there's the fact that the characters were very well written. Dialogues seemed natural and I wanted to continue engaging in small talk just to learn more of characters' perspectives. 

While watching Madeline accept Badeline, I could feel the accompanying strength coursing through her - because of how effortlessly she now glided past chasms and deadly traps. 

It all felt cathartic.

#### Game design

As a player, I find Celeste to be incredibly well designed, from a user experience standpoint. 

Firstly, the game recognizes that it can be incredibly challenging, and encourages the user to try using the assist mode in case the user is having trouble beating a certain level. 

The assist mode lets users slow down the game speed, increase stamina/jump ability, and even grant themselves invincibility. 

This move has a lot of my respect because it saves me a lot of time I'd have otherwise spent trying to press the right keys at the right times. 

I'm no hardcore gamer, and I don't want that stopping me from enjoying the plot or music or content that lies past the level I'm incapable of completing - and Celeste solves this in such a simple manner, that I wish more games took inspiration from it. 

The controls are great, intuitive and tight. At no point did I blame my failure on my controls - every time I failed, I knew my failure was the consequence of my mistake, and not the game's. 

Then there's the campfire chat. After the cable cart ride, when Madeline and Theo chat over the campfire, the user is allowed to choose conversation branches from either side. 

You get to pick who asks what question, and the other person answers them. 

This, combined with the interesting personalities of both characters, made for a very engaging conversation that I was quite interested in -- and the flow of the conversation felt natural to me since I was the one controlling the topics discussed. 

Then come the strawberries - the game makes it clear upfront that collecting strawberries does nothing but is just an achievement or bragging right - which is nice because I now know that I don't need to go outta my way to collect them. 

Then there's the music - one thing I loved in super meat boy was that the music in that game never restarted when you die. 

Celeste, like super meat boy, knows that you'll die often in each level. And so the music is never restarted upon respawning - it just continues. And that's great for keeping me immersed in my train of thought.

#### Art

I fell in love with the art style of this game. 

When I first controlled Madeline, the screen I was looking at disappointed me. It felt like it wasn't leveraging everything that a PlayStation 4 was capable of and the only reason I proceeded with the game was because I paid for it. 

Then the game continued and I saw the first chat box and the art quality instantly rocketed up, surprising me and raising my expectations. 

The art progressively got better and eventually I was consuming absolute eye-candy on every stage. 

Here's what I mean -

#### Music

Celeste is a game where you fail often - and so it's music does a great job of not being repetitive, annoying or sounding out of place. 

It fits into the background well and sets the right mood - be it a tense confrontation or roaring courage or any other emotion the game is invoking. 

It fades from attention when you're trying to nail a platforming section but enters the spotlight during key moments or when your momentum is high. 

It's incredibly well designed and I write this article with Celeste's OST playing on Spotify in the background.

#### Conclusion

Celeste has raised my bar for platformers - in fact I may find it unfair to compare future games I play with Celeste since it feels like I now have a personal connection with this game. 

I'm glad I played it.
