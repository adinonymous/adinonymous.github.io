In my irl friend circle, as of today, I know nobody who has hit a social media following of 10K. 

Yesterday, I hit that milestone.

My takeaway from it was that its... a little bit of a letdown.

Though I suppose I should clarify - I did experience the short-term endorphin surge of accomplishing a goal I was chasing; the joy of being rewarded for patience and consistency and effort - after all, it did take me close to half a year of nearly daily sketching to go from 0 to the 10 thousand follower milestone - and yet, today's the second day past hitting that mark and yet I don't think I spent more than an aggregate 5 minutes thinking about it all day.

And right now I'm unsure if I really wanted to hit this milestone that badly, or if I only was in love with the idea of how hitting this milestone would probably make me feel. I doubt desensitization could be the case, I just went from 4-digits to 5-digits - I imagined it should've felt significantly different.

Hell, I remember back when I was at 1.5K followers, I craved a following so bad that I'd DM people who liked an art post of mine inviting them to take a look at some of my other work in the hopes of speeding things up. 

And I find myself wondering at what point did I change during this whole journey? Probably yesterday when I hit that milestone, but surely multiple past events would've influenced my reaction to yesterday, right? 

Funnily, in an ironical way, my previous blog post was on taking steps toward getting over the craving for internet validation - and now here I am questioning why I seem to have stopped caring. 

And worst of all, today I skipped drawing. The voice in my head said "You hit 10K, why draw today?" - which terrifies me because now I find myself questioning the actual intent behind why I was drawing all along!

I was under the impression that I liked drawing - which I still believe I do - but the idea that I don't like drawing enough to want to make time for it by going out of my way is bothersome - and a scarier idea is the alternative implication - that I only drew for fame.

Sure, the only reason I dived deeper and deeper into art was because of all the positive reinforcements I was getting in the form of compliments and reactions and perhaps since I was raised to believe I was good at art, but it would disappoint me if that was the only reason I drew. 

I still do believe I am interested in art, but I'm only unsure of to what end now. I have plenty of affirmations to place faith in for this - I still am amazed by terrific artists, I still analyze and study images to deconstruct the lines and shapes to see how I could replicate those effects - so it's nice to know that a fundamental, primary "artistic" part of me is still alive, but I'm still searching for Mr. Motivation.

Oh look, in the midst of writing this, I saw more irony to this situation - months ago I imagined hitting 10K followers was "the end goal" and today I realize in some way its probably just the beginning of me trying to unravel the implications and doubts raised by my behavior in order for me to understand me better.

That or I can dismiss all of the above and just stick to drawing on a daily basis to clear the doubt- nope, I already feel like I don't want to do that. **WHY DO I NOT WANT TO DO THAT** okay im gonna go and nap and clear my head and then maybe update this article after a while. maybe.


### UPDATE:

I spent some time thinking about this. That voice in my head, the one that went 
> You hit 10K, why draw today?

feels a lot like it really meant to say

> You hit 10K, why draw today? What more do you have to prove?

Which raises more questions. Yay me.

Well, this has become quite the personal blog post, and while I'm all for sharing introspection, this seems to be better resolved inside my head since thoughts are rapidly flowing even as I type this. Also, if you find this blog post via SEO or non-me means, please know that -

1. I'd be surprised cause I have intentionally made 0 attempts at optimizing SEO here.

2. A fancy follower count might actually be overrated. All it takes is consistency, time and a little part of your soul. :)
