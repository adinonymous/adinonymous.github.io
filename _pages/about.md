Hello internet. I go by the pseudonym - Adinonymous. But that's cumbersome to repeat, so you can just call me Adi.

I have no intention to commit to any goals that this blog will endeavor to achieve.

This is only a place to dump my thoughts, ideas and opinions, while also catering to my needs of changing the UI using Jekyll - my site generator.

That being said, if you are a reader whom I have not personally entrusted my identity to, I hope you enjoy my content.

Also, this is the first time I'm embracing anonymity. I expect a different adventure, and today is the first step!
